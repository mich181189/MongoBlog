To Build from git:

run ./toolconfig.sh

then continue as below:

To build from tarball:

You need libMongoClient installed, and relevant libboost versions.
It's basically the standard install/configure step, except you set the bin dir
to the location you want the cgi to be in.

./configure --bindir=/path/to/cgi
make
(then as root)
make install

if you get errors about the shared object not being found,
try running ldconfig as root.

Configuring:
copy the folder mbTemplates to one level above the executable, then:

cd /path/to/installed/cgi
./MongoDbConfig

and answer the questions.

Security
===============

I strongly recommend adding the included htaccess file next to the CGI because otherwise the config program
will be runnable from the internet, which causes the webserver to lock up due to it not being a 
CGI program, and waiting for input. The htaccess file solves this, and makes nicer URLs as well
(like /blog/post/post-id/ to access a post)
